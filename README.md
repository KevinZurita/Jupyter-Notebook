# Jupyter-Notebook

Hello!
This jupyter notebook is just a little side project where I tried to create a map of chicago only using public taxi data. The inital data set that I used had about 7 million rows. In order to handle the volume of data I decided to use Google Big Query. GBQ is nice in that you can query it on googles platorm and then connect to the API and call the query. While, the data set was very large to begin with when I extracted the NULL values and queried the cooridnate values the data set shrank to only 850 rows. It lead to some rather lack luster results. There was enough data to get a rough outline of the city but nothing that really made the image POP!
